# BRANCHING

### CREATE A NEW BRANCH:  
`git checkout -b feature_branch_name`  

- Edit, add and commit your files.  
- Push your branch to the remote repository:  

`git push -u origin origin/feature_branch_name`  

### RENAME BRANCH
`git branch -m old-branch_name new-branch_name`

#### DELETE BRANCH
`git branch -d branch_name`  
`git branch -D branch_name`  

- The -d option stands for --delete, which would delete the local branch, only if you have already pushed and merged it with your remote branches.  
- The -D option stands for --delete --force, which deletes the branch regardless of its push and merge status, so be careful using this one!  
  
#### DELETE BRANCH ON REMOTE  
`git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>`  
`git reset --hard` - deletes all local changes and resets all  

# TAG
`git tag -a <TAG_NAME>`  
`git push origin <TAG_NAME>`  


# STASHING  

### STASH  
`git stash -u` - stash with included untracked changes  
`git stash -a` - stash untracked and ignored  
`git stash push -a -m "named_stash"` - stash all with name `named_stash`  


### STASH APPLY  
`git stash apply` - retrieve changes from the stash and apply them to your branch  
`git stash apply stash@{2}` - apply 2nd change from git stash  
`git stash apply stash^{/named_stash}` - apply named stash  

### STASH DROP  
`git stash drop <name>`  - drop name stash

### STASH LIST  
`git statsh list` - list stash

### STASH CLEAR  
`git stash clear` - clear all stash  
  
# MERGE  
`git checkout master`  
`git checkout -b new-branch`  
  
...develop some code...  
  
`git add .`  
`git commit â€“m "Some commit message"`  
`git checkout master`  

#### without new commit message  
`git merge new-branch`    
  
#### with new commit message  
`git merge -no-ff new-branch -m "merging master into new-branch"`    
  
### UNDO PUSHED MERGE  

`git checkout develop`  

develop some code..

`git commit -m "developing some code"`  

push changes on remote  

`git push origin develop`

checkout master branch: `git checkout master`  

NOW merge master into develop   `git merge develop`  

push to remote `git push origin master`

master branch has now all changes from develop branch  

REVERTING MERGE COMMIT  

`git checkout master`  

`git log`

find hash of merge commit you wish to UNDO  

`git revert -m 1 <merge-commit> `

<pre>
    With `-m 1` we tell git to revert to the first parent of the mergecommit on the master branch. 
    With `-m 2` would specify to revert to the first parent on the develop branch where the merge came from initially.
</pre>  

Now commit the revert and push changes to the remote repo and you are done.

# REWRITING HISTORY OF GIT I.E SOFT RESET
- move head 20 commits in the past
`git reset --soft HEAD@{20}`
