# BRANCHING

### CREATE A NEW BRANCH:  
`git checkout -b feature_branch_name`  

### TRACK BRANCH
`git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote/branch name>`  

- Edit, add and commit your files.  
- Push your branch to the remote repository:  

`git push -u origin origin/feature_branch_name`  

### RENAME BRANCH
`git branch -m old-branch_name new-branch_name`

#### DELETE BRANCH
`git branch -d branch_name`  
`git branch -D branch_name`  

- The -d option stands for --delete, which would delete the local branch, only if you have already pushed and merged it with your remote branches.  
- The -D option stands for --delete --force, which deletes the branch regardless of its push and merge status, so be careful using this one!  
  
#### DELETE BRANCH ON REMOTE  

`git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>`  

deletes all local changes and resets all  
    `git reset --hard` 

# TAGGING
    `git tag -a <TAG_NAME>`  
    `git push origin <TAG_NAME>`  


# STASHING  

stash with included untracked changes  

    `git stash -u` 
stash untracked and ignored  

    `git stash -a`  
stash all with name `named_stash`  

    `git stash push -a -m "named_stash"` 


## STASH APPLY  
retrieve changes from the stash and apply them to your branch  

    `git stash apply` 
apply 2nd change from git stash  

    `git stash apply stash@{2}` 
apply named stash  

    `git stash apply stash^{/named_stash}` 

## STASH DROP  
drop name stash

    `git stash drop <name>`  

## STASH LIST  
list stash  

    `git stash list` 

## STASH CLEAR  

clear all stash  

    `git stash clear`   

# MERGE  
checkout master

    `git checkout master`  
create new branch  

    `git checkout -b new-branch`  
  
...develop some code...  
  
`git add .`  
`git commit â€“m "Some commit message"`  
`git checkout master`  

#### WITHOUT NEW COMMIT MESSAGE  

    `git merge new-branch`    
  
#### WITH NEW COMMIT MESSAGE  

    `git merge -no-ff new-branch -m "merging master into new-branch"`    
  
# UNDO PUSHED MERGE  

    `git checkout develop`  

develop some code..

    `git commit -m "developing some code"`  

push changes on remote  

    `git push origin develop`

checkout master branch: 

    `git checkout master`  

NOW merge master into develop   

    `git merge develop`  

push to remote 

    `git push origin master`

master branch has now all changes from develop branch  

# REVERTING MERGE COMMIT  

    `git checkout master`  

    `git log`

find hash of merge commit you wish to UNDO  
    `git revert -m 1 <merge-commit> `

    With `-m 1` we tell git to revert to the first parent of the mergecommit on the master branch. 

    With `-m 2` would specify to revert to the first parent on the develop branch where the merge came from initially.

Now commit the revert and push changes to the remote repo and you are done.

    git branch -D master  
Rename the current branch to master

    git branch -m master  
Force push master branch to Git server 

    git push -f origin master  
  
# REWRITING HISTORY OF GIT I.E SOFT RESET

   `git reset --soft HEAD@{20}` 

 stage all 20 files
