Thanks ‚Äî that changes things.

Since your service uses a **GUI**, it must start **after the graphical environment is ready**, and possibly even **under a specific user‚Äôs graphical session** (like GNOME, KDE, etc). GUI services are trickier because systemd's default targets like `multi-user.target` are for non-graphical environments.

## üîç Why it's marked `static` (recap for GUI context)

If your GUI service is marked `static`, it's likely because:

1. It **has no `[Install]` section**, **or**
2. It‚Äôs a **user service** (not a system-wide one), and user services are usually started by the session manager, not enabled in the same way.

## ‚úÖ Solutions Based on Your Use Case

### ‚úÖ Option 1: GUI Service for a Specific User (Recommended for most desktop apps)

If you're running something graphical **as a desktop user**, you should create a **user-level systemd service**, not a system-wide one.

#### üõ† Steps:

1. **Put your service file in:**

```bash
~/.config/systemd/user/my-gui-app.service
```

2. **Example user service:**

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My GUI App
After=graphical-session.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/your-gui-app
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

3. **Enable it for your user session:**

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable my-gui-app.service
systemctl --user start my-gui-app.service
```

4. (Optional) Enable lingering if you want it to run even when you're not logged in:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger your-username
```

### ‚úÖ Option 2: GUI App as a System-Wide Service (less common)

This is only appropriate if your app is somehow GUI-capable but doesn‚Äôt require a logged-in user (e.g., using a virtual display). You‚Äôd need to set a display and environment variables, which is fragile.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is **not recommended** unless you have a specific use case, like a kiosk setup.

## üîç Key Notes for GUI Services

* `graphical.target` is the boot target that brings up the GUI (display manager).
* A GUI app typically needs `$DISPLAY` and `$XAUTHORITY` set, which are only available in user sessions.
* Systemd user services are the right tool if the app is meant to run **after login**, with access to the GUI.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Use Case                       | Correct Setup                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| GUI app after login (normal)   | User-level service in `~/.config/systemd/user/`        |
| GUI app always running (kiosk) | System-level service with display/env setup (advanced) |

If you paste your `.service` file and explain when/where you want it to run, I can give you a precise fix.
