### power of g    
`:[range]g/pattern/cmd`      
- This acts on the specified [range] (default whole file),       
  by executing the Ex command cmd for each line matching pattern       
  (an Ex command is one starting with a colon such as :d for delete).      
  Before executing cmd, "." is set to the current line.

`zo` open the folded code      
`zc` close the folded code      
`za` toggle the folded code      
    
### Jump to definition  
`gd`- will take you to the local declaration.  
`gD`- will take you to the global declaration.  
`g*`- search for the word under the cursor (like *, but g* on 'rain' will find words like 'rainbow').  
`g#`- same as g* but in backward direction.  
`gg`- goes to the first line in the buffer (or provide a count before the command for a specific line).  
`G` - goes to the last line (or provide a count before the command for a specific line).  
`gf`- will go to the file under the cursor  
`g]`- and other commands will jump to a tag definition (a tag can be a function or variable name, or more).  
  
### CTAGS  
`ctags --languages=java -R ./src` - generate tags file in src folder  
  
### Marks    
```    
'a - 'z		lowercase marks, valid within one file      
'A - 'Z		uppercase marks, also called file marks, valid between files      
'0 - '9		numbered marks, set from .viminfo file      
```    
    
`    
Lowercase marks 'a to 'z are remembered as long as the file remains in the      
buffer list.  If you remove the file from the buffer list, all its marks are      
lost.  If you delete a line that contains a mark, that mark is erased.      
`    
    
`    
Lowercase marks can be used in combination with operators.  For example: "d't"      
deletes the lines from the cursor position to mark 't'.  Hint: Use mark 't' for      
Top, 'b' for Bottom, etc..  Lowercase marks are restored when using undo and      
redo.    
`    
    
`    
Uppercase marks 'A to 'Z include the file name.  You can use them to jump from    
file to file.  You can only use an uppercase mark with an operator if the mark    
is in the current file.  The line number of the mark remains correct, even if    
you insert/delete lines or edit another file for a moment.  When the 'viminfo'    
option is not empty, uppercase marks are kept in the .viminfo file.  See    
|viminfo-file-marks|.    
`    
    
`  
Numbered marks '0 to '9 are quite different.  They can not be set directly.    
They are only present when using a viminfo file |viminfo-file|.  Basically '0    
is the location of the cursor when you last exited Vim, '1 the last but one    
time, etc.  Use the "r" flag in 'viminfo' to specify files for which no    
Numbered mark should be stored.  See |viminfo-file-marks|.    
`  
  
`mk` -  mark the current position as k (any other lowercase letter will do)    
`mK` -  mark the current position as K. Uppercase means that it is a global mark, and it will be available even if you currently have a different file opened.    
`'k` -  jump to the position previously marked as k    
`delmarks A-Z0-9` - delete all marks    

  
### Working with files  
`:Files` - open fzf in current dir and search bellow  
  - `Crtl + t` - opens file in new tab
  - `Ctrl + v` - opens file in new vertical split
  - `Ctrl + x` - opens file in new horizontal split  

`:GFiles` - open Gfiles in current dir and search below  
  - `Crtl + t` - opens file in new tab
  - `Ctrl + v` - opens file in new vertical split
  - `Ctrl + x` - opens file in new horizontal split  

`chdir [full/path/to/wanted/dir]` - changes the search path for fzf or Gfiles  
    
### copy paste remaps    
`vmap <leader>y "+y`    
`vmap <leader>d "+d`    
`nmap <leader>p "+p`    
`nmap <leader>P "+P`    
`vmap <leader>p "+p`    
`vmap <leader>P "+P`    
    
### VIM FZF  
`Ctrl+o [file_name] Ctrl+t` - open file in new tab  
  
### FOLDING HTML

```
setlocal foldmethod=syntax
```

`.vim/after/syntax/html/html.vim`

```
